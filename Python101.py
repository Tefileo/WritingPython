# Variables In Python
    # A variable is a box. And we put stuff inside and give it a name.

# Assign a variable
# gave the box a name and put stuff inside

    box_pillows = 'pillows and stuff'

# look inside box

    print(box_pillows)

# Re assignment of a variable
# changing the stuff inside the box

    box_pillows = 'Books'
    print(box_pillows)
    box_pillows = 14
    print(box_pillows)

# Important functions in python

print('hello hello i am a string')
